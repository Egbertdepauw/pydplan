# How to install PYDPLANNER



## Installation instructions

pydplan is written in Python 3.6 and will run on any Python environment supporting at least version 3.6. The GUI depends on [PyQt5](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyQt5) (Qt version 5 bindings for Python 3). It will run on Windows and most Linux GUI desktops.

To install and run the application there are following prerequisites:

- install Python version 3.6 or newer to your system
- install PyQt5 package (for the GUI)
- clone the source files from github
  - if you do not have git, then it stronly recommended to get git before this step, 
  - see: [Git guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
- run the app

## Install Python, general info

[https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)

## Python &amp; PyQt5 for Windows

Python is not by default in Windows, so you will need to install it separately.

Install latest Python:

[https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

Install pyqt5

python -m pip install pyqt5

## Python &amp; PyQt5 for Linux

Often Python is already installed in many Linux distributions, so you might not need to do anything here. So check first that if your system already has Python 3. From command line &quot;python â€“version&quot;. You should see version 3.6 or later to use pydplan.

Install latest Python:

[https://www.python.org/downloads/source/](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/)

PytQt5 is an extra package, so you need to install pyqt5 separately using pip
```
sudo pip3 install PyQt5
```
# Get sources from github

If you have git command line client in your system, the following command will clone you the pydplan source repository to you system:
```
git clone [https://github.com/eianlei/pydplan.git](https://github.com/eianlei/pydplan.git)
```
## Download ZIP

In a Windows system you do not have GIT installed by default, so a quick and dirty alternative is to simply download the sources from the GitHub project page by selecting from &quot;Clone or download&quot;, &quot;Download ZIP&quot;, to get all the source files in one archive:

pydplan-master.zip

Which then needs to be unzipped.

## Get updates
To get the latest updated version from the git master branch to you local cloned repo, you give the following command:
```
git pull https://github.com/eianlei/pydplan.git master
```

# Run application:

Once you have done all previous steps you should be able to launch the application by issuing the following command in the directory where you cloned the pydplan sources::
```
python pydplan\_main.py
```
You should now see the application main window appearing:
